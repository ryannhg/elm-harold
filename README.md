### "y tho?"

I was wondering if I could run Elm on the backend, in a NodeJS environment.

I totally can. So that's neat.

It was also go`od practice with using ports in Elm, the way [Murphy Randle taught me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3pL85n9_5s)!

Also I got to try out [Joel's advice](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/problem-solving-with-maybe) on using the `Maybe` functions to keep uncertainty at the edge of my program.

Thanks, my dudes!


### Try it out:

1. `npm install`

1. `npm start`
